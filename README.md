## Introduction:
  Local businesses have no platform to promote their business. Bigger businesses have their own websites, adverts and other promotional contents. But Local businesses are the ones people trust the most when it comes to small professions like tailors, Book Stores, Medical Stores etc. They are overlooked even when they are just within the reach of the customers and provide cheaper and better services. Cyber Impact is a platform where everyone can promote their small businesses by creating their own profile and place their business in one of the many provided categories so that the users of the website can look at all the local businesses in his/her area and choose the suitable one based on the rating or distance. Thus allowing the locals to expand their business to a bigger public and providing ease to users in finding just the shop they are looking for.
